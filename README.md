<!-- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN -->
## Implementation Plan

The following steps will be taken to create and deploy the Emotional Analysis Application:

1. Selection of cloud computing platform: A cloud computing platform will be selected for hosting the application, based on factors such as cost, scalability, and reliability.

2. Development of machine learning algorithms: The machine learning algorithms will be developed to analyze images and videos and identify emotions of the people in the content.

3. Storage of images and videos: A storage solution will be implemented to store the images and videos that will be analyzed by the machine learning algorithms.

4. Design of user interface: A user interface will be designed to allow users to upload images and videos and view the emotional insights provided by the application.

5. Testing and deployment of the application: The application will be thoroughly tested to ensure it is functioning correctly, and then deployed on the chosen cloud computing platform.
